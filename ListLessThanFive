# Take a list, say for example this one:
#   a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
#
# Extras:
# Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5
# from this list in it and print out this new list.
# Write this in one line of Python.
# Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a
# that are smaller than that number given by the user.

ListA = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

#Solution #1

for i in ListA:
    if i < 5 :
        print(i)



 #Solution#2
ListB=[]
for i in ListA:
    if i < 5:
        ListB.append(i)
print(ListB)

#one line solution
ListC=list(filter(lambda x:x<5,ListA))
print(ListC)

#User input
lim = int(input("Enter a number:"))
ListD=list(filter(lambda x:x<lim,ListA))
print(ListD)
